            <p>Her and I were strangers who happened to share an abusive ex, so as I went looking in the dark for answers -  she appeared like a dream. As a way to heal we went to the beach to bond by filming two seperate independent projects, now sometimes when I dream I can still feel the sun burning into me.

            <p>These videos like life, can and do exist on their own. So play them one at a time. </p>
            <p>However life like these videos are never that simple - so play them at the same time and experience how layers truly create our reality.
